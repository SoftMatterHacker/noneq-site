# What we do

We work with industry and academic partners to design fluids with smart response, particles with custom shape and performance, and flow behavior linked directly to product and material performance.

Are you trying to formulate, or scale up manufacture of, a fluid that behaves differently depending on its history? Even when its composition doesnâ€™t change? We get it.
