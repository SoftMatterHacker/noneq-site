# Abstract and optional shortened version.

abstract_short = "Lipid-based lyotropic liquid crystals were identified nearly 50 years ago, but the last twenty years have seen a rise in interest in part due to their fascinating geometrical versatility, their utility in food and pharmaceutical applications, and an emerging understanding of their role in biological processes. In part, the versatility stems from the ability to disperse the materials as stable particles, but also from the possibility to finely control transitions between different structures for applications in diagnostics and triggered release. We have been working together and separately to understand the formation and structure of these particles and how to control their geometry in response a wide range of exogenous and endogenous stimuli using techniques from optical microscopy, rheology, cryo-TEM, and small angle X-ray scattering."
