# What we do

Complex fluids are systems where small amounts of additives, like colloids, polymers, and surfactants, have a disproportionate effect on bulk flow.

A key focus for us is how microstructure and flow interact, and we collaborate with our partners to understand complex fluid effects on product and material performance.

More background can be found in the following links to our [group focus areas]({{< ref "post/WhoWeAre.md" >}}), [group members]({{< ref "post/people.md" >}}), and [UNSW site](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-patrick-spicer).

UNSW Honours students: please consult [our current project offerings.]({{< ref "post/HonoursProjects.md" >}}) 

Prospective PhD students: [this page]({{< ref "#projects" >}}) details our current funded projects as well as examples of the topical areas of our PhD and MS projects.
