abstract = "For two approaching oil droplets, a region of arrested coalescence lies between full coalescence and total stability. Here the fusion of two droplets begins, but they are stopped from fully relaxing into one spherical droplet. The internal rigidity of the solid fat network within each droplet can provide the resistance necessary to arrest the shape change driven by Laplace pressure. These intermediate doublet structures lead to the partially‚Äêcoalesced fat networks important for the desired physical properties of ice cream and whipped topping. The use of micromanipulation techniques allows coalescence events between two oil droplets to be microscopically observed. In this study, oil droplets composed of different fats were manipulated at varying elastic moduli, interfacial tension, and radii. It was seen that increasing the elastic moduli of the droplets or increasing droplet radii resulted in coalescence being arrested earlier. Under these experimental conditions, different interfacial tensions did not change the coalescence behavior between two oil droplets."
