abstract = "Dispersed particles of bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase, cubosomes, are self-assembled nanostructured particles that can be formed in aqueous lipid and surfactant systems. Contributions to cubosome research have come from the fields of biology, material science, medicine, and mathematics and much is known about their formation and properties. At the center of much of the discovery and innovation is the technique of cryo-transmission electron microscopy. Most of the research into cubosomes is motivated by potential applications in drug delivery and material synthesis although no commercialized product based on cubosomes is known. Recent advances in understanding and use of cubosomes are discussed in the context of some of the more promising application areas and the opportunities for microscopy techniques to make unique contributions to these areas."
