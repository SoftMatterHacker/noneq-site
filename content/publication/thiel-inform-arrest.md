# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Arrested coalescence, also known as partial coalescence, occurs when fat globules begin to merge, but do not fully combine into a single spherical globule. Partially-coalesced fat networks are key in products like ice cream, whipped topping, and whipped cream for desired textural and rheological properties. Micromanipulation is the first technique that allows direct observation of fat globules undergoing coalescence instead of inferring results from indirect methods."
