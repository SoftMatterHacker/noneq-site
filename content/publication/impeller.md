abstract = "The effect of impeller type and shear rate on the evolution of floc size and structure during shear-induced flocculation of polystyrene particles with aluminum sulfate is investigated by image analysis. One radial flow (six-blade Rushton turbine) and two axial flow (three-blade fluid foil, four-blade 45Â° pitch) impeller configurations are examined. The steady state average floc size is shown to depend on the frequency of recirculation to the impeller zone and its characteristic velocity gradient. The concepts of fractal geometry are used to characterize the floc structure. For all impellers, the two-dimensional floc fractal dimension, Dpf, increases during floc growth, indicating formation of more open structures. Later on, Dpf levels off at a steady state value as breakage becomes significant and the floc size distribution approaches steady state. The shear rate does not affect the steady state Dpf of the flocs within experimental uncertainty."
