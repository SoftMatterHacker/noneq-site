# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Soft, rotationally symmetric particles of dispersed hexagonal liquid crystalline phase are produced using a method previously developed for cubosome microparticle production. The technique forms hexosome particles via removal of ethanol from emulsion droplets containing monoolein, water, and one of the various hydrophobic molecules: vitamin E, hexadecane, oleic acid, cyclohexane, or divinylbenzene. The unique rotational symmetry of the particles is characterized by optical microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering to link particle phase, shape, and structure to composition. Rheology of the soft particles can be varied independently of shape, enabling control of transport, deformation, and biological response by controlling composition and molecular structure of the additives. The direct observations of formation, and the resultant hexosome shapes, link the particle-scale and mesoscale properties of these novel self-assembled particles and broaden their applications. The micron-scale hexosomes provide a route to understanding the effects of particle size, crystallization rate, and rheology on the production of soft particles with liquid crystalline structure and unique shape and symmetry."
