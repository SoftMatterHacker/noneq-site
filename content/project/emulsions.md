## Project summary
Emulsion droplets are used in vaccines, pesticides, cosmetics, and foods, by dispersing one liquid, like an oil, in another, like water.
Typically interfacial tension between the two liquids shapes them into spheres, but tuning the rheology of the droplet volume or interface can offset interfacial tension and allow droplets to adopt novel, non-spherical, shapes.
This effect has been used to improve delivery of active ingredients in consumer products and is now being explored as a delivery enhancer for aerosol medicines.

## Project objectives

* Develop new, unusual, bio-inspired shapes of droplets and test their performance at targeted delivery
* Study the flow of shaped droplets in microfluidic channels
* Create droplets that mimic bacterial motion using active enzymatic driving forces to control motion and shape change
