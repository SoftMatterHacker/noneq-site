## Project summary
This work will enhance the efficiency of aerosolised sprays in agricultural applications, lowering the cost and expanding the availability of these materials in developing countries. 
Serious consequences of excess runoff of liquid sprays, either onto the ground and into the water supply, will be avoided.
We have developed a simple fluid with a complex flow response that makes it up to ten times more efficient than much more concentrated conventional formulations.
## Project objectives

* Develop scaled-up production of novel spray additives
* High-speed imaging studies of drop impact on leaves and insects
* Optimisation of drone spraying formulations and performance on grape leaves, powdery mildew surfaces, and harmful insects
