## Project summary
With around 6M Australians suffering from respiratory illnesses, the financial burden on the health care
system is over $150m annually. Current therapies have potential side-effects and are ineffective in COPD
and steroid insensitive asthma. We will develop an approach to treating these diseases and a technology
capable of delivering high efficiency aerosols to lung. Using microfluidics we will generate Smartdrops with
controlled geometry that has commercial impact in a number of industries.

## Project objectives

* We will develop a particle engineering technology, based on microfluidics, that results in micro-droplets with controlled geometry and morphology. 
* An aerosol inhaler and a series of physico-chemical characterisation tools will be used to study Smartdrop formation and aerosol properties.
* Incorporation of drug particles and formation during delivery will be quantified and used as a design basis for delivery optimisation.
