## Project summary
Many measurements and determinations can be made on fluids by measuring their mechanical, or rheological, properties. 
Examples include the identification of cancer cells, detection of instabilities in protein solutions, and the creation of advanced thin films.
Rheology is usually measured with milliliters of fluid, but study of microstructural behaviour in complex fluids requires measurement at microscopic length scales.

## Project objectives

* Learn to use advanced microrheometers that manipulate microscopic bubbles and magnets to measure fluid flow
* Screen biological and industrial fluids for complex flow and responsive behaviour
* Develop links between microscale measurements and commercial or industrial material performance measures
