## Project summary
The proposed research will greatly expand research into fluids with complex and valuable microstructures: this includes foods, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, and even blood. 
Key Australian X-ray and Nuclear facilities provide amazing insights into valuable and exotic material structures every day, but most of these measurements are on static samples. 
Because flow and mixing is critical to industry and advanced research processes that develop new materials, a facility is needed that allows the same careful study of material structure with the addition of controlled flow. 
We will build such facilities, enabling study of high-speed, stretching, and other complex flows

## Project objectives

* Beamline rheometers
* Microfluidic flow capability on beamlines
* Extensional flow and imaging
