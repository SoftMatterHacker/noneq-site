## Project summary
Production of soft, faceted colloids is now possible using a simple process of droplet production. The resulting particles can be used for self-assembly applications as well as unique methods of destroying infecting bacteria.
The particles have a complex liquid crystalline structure that has unique acoustic, flow, and biological properties that we'd like to explore as a means of developing hierarchical nanomaterials.
Exploration of these particles for different applications can now be carried out.

## Project objectives

* Make faceted particles with a range of shapes and sizes, then test them to see how faceting affects bacterial interactions
* Add polymeric species to modify the mechanical strength of the particles
* Study the unique acoustic resonance of these particles and their ability to amplify or cancel sounds
