## Project summary
The bacteria that produce vinegar and kombucha also produce nanofibers of pure cellulose, creating the structure of the SCOBY familiar to many homebrewers.
Nanocellulose is extremely strong, is biodegradable, and can be produced from simple feedstocks like sugar.
The area is an active research topic, with many people dispersing nanocellulose and creating composite materials via novel manufacturing processes.

We are using strong interfacial and flow stresses to direct the growth of nanofibers during the fermentation, avoiding the need to process the cellulose before creating a final structure.
An example is the templating of emulsion droplets by the bacteria to create very low density microcapsules.
New reactors have been developed to direct bacterial growth through passive variations in food concentrations, producing new biocomposites.

## Project objectives

* Study control parameters of bacterial growth during externally-controlled fermentations
* Evaluate the strength and delivery capacity of dried films and develop other functional structures
* Create new responsive structures that adopt secondary forms during drying or other stimulus
