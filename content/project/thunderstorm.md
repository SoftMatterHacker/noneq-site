## Project summary
Many measurements and determinations can be made on fluids by measuring their mechanical, or rheological, properties. 
Examples include the identification of cancer cells, detection of instabilities in protein solutions, and the creation of advanced thin films.
Rheology is usually measured with milliliters of fluid, but study of microstructural behaviour in complex fluids requires measurement at microscopic length scales.

Thunderstorm asthma can cause a sudden rise in breathing difficulty and death, even for patients without a history of asthma.
The full physical mechanism of thunderstorm asthma has not been determined, and no diagnostic test can identify exact risk of occurrence.
Surface modification of pollen and other suspended particles is not understood in the complex environment of thunderclouds.

## Project objectives

* Direct study of rupture and release of allergenic proteins by pollen grains
* Surface modification of pollen and atmospheric aerosols using plasma discharge and chemical treatment
* Production of test nanoparticles and proteins for inflammation assessment in nasal cells
