This post says it all:

This approach has saved me so many times when I knew what I wanted to write _about_, but was stuck _how_ to write it.

I keep a folder of papers I found to be some combination of:

1. Clear
2. Enjoyable
3. Smart
4. Concise
5. Visionary

and work from those outlines when I'm in need of inspiration.
