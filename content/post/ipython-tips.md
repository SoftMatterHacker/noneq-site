A lot of our microstructural work is performed in concert with microrheological measurements
using microscopic observations of colloidal tracer particles moving within a complex fluid.

The analysis of these movies is easy these days, thanks to people who developed a number of
open and freely available routines to ease the initial steps:

Particle tracking microrheology is performed by many folks using IDL:
[Particle tracking using IDL](http://www.physics.emory.edu/faculty/weeks//idl/)

or Matlab routines:
[The Matlab Particle Tracking Code Repository](http://site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/)

but a more recent Python setup has found great use in our group:
[Trackpy: Fast, Flexible Particle-Tracking Toolkit](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/v0.3.2/)

David Pine gives an excellent introduction to using Python, and iPython notebooks here:
