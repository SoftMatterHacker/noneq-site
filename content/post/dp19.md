The Complex Fluids Group at UNSW had a run of excellent luck this year, with two three-year Discovery grants funded by the ARC for 2019-2021.
The two projects are quite different, reflecting the diversity of applications we research.
Interestingly, both projects have a common thread related to plants and agriculture, a new direction for us.

The first project, based at UNSW Chemical Engineering, will study the coating performance of fluids with minimal additives that avoid the use of more harmful surfactant ingredients.
The work will combine the fluid design and characterization capability of our group with the spray and aerosol expertise of the [Woolcock Institute for Medical Research](https://woolcock.org.au/).
The proposal information and abstract is below:

### DP190102614 A/Prof Patrick Spicer and Prof Paul Young - $465,000 - FOR code: 0703

> Engineering better sprays for leaf coating: from drop impact to retention. This proposal aims to understand the performance of a unique rheological modifier that can enable an order of magnitude increase in coating efficiency for aerosol sprays while not affecting the quality of droplet formation during spraying. The effect occurs via a dispersed network of fibrous particles in water, providing a weak but useful ability to coat surfaces by responsively adjusting its structure. The material is expected to enable a broad array of applications, from agricultural treatments to nasal sprays, by exhibiting responsive behaviour at concentrations much lower than conventional modifiers require. The project will study the responsiveness of the system in single droplet, spray, and coating form as well as an active delivery system. 

The second project, based at U. Sydney and the [Woolcock](https://woolcock.org.au/news-4/why-we-need-a-national-approach-to-thunderstorm-asthma?rq=thunderstorm), will study the physical mechanisms of the [thunderstorm asthma phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm_asthma).
We will carry out high-energy plasma treatment of various pollen grains to simulate thunderstorm exposure and examine the surface chemistry and cellular response to the nanoparticles produced from the zapped pollen.
The proposal information and abstract is below:

> Cause and effect: new mechanisms of particle formation in thunderstorms. This project aims to identify meaningful and specific indicators for predicting particle formation and alteration during thunderstorms. How thunderstorms develop is well-understood. However, identifying meaningful and specific indicators for predicting particle alteration during a thunderstorm is still not clear. This project will practically contribute to the evidence of the impact of air particulates, thereby having direct implications for meteorological, and air pollution policy in Australia and worldwide. This project will allow researchers to understand the impact of these factors on the escalation of the causative effects, and to find a way to prevent unnecessary fatal outcomes.
