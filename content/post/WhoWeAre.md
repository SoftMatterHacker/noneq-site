We are the Complex Fluids Group at UNSW. Our team works with industry and academic partners 
to design smart fluids with unique response and flow behaviour linked directly to product and material performance. 

Fluids containing small amounts of colloids, polymers, and surfactants can exhibit highly non-ideal behaviour with fascinating dynamics. 
Complex fluids are a key part of most major products and manufacturing processes. Our group uses advanced imaging and rheology techniques 
to understand fundamental properties of complex fluid components, specifically: shape, structure, and flow.

__Research Interests__: Design and development of microstructured fluid materials by understanding their kinetic behavior. Most of our work deals with complex fluids, fluids containing small amounts of colloids, polymers, and surfactants that exhibit highly non-ideal behaviour with fascinating dynamics. Complex fluids are a key part of most major products and manufacturing processes. Our group uses advanced imaging and rheology techniques to understand fundamental complex fluid properties, specifically:

## Shape - Particle shape affects advanced material strength, reactivity, and biological uptake.

## Structure - Self-assembly creates soft structures with biological, chemical, and physical applications.

## Flow - Microstructured fluids are a part of most commercial products, and processes, and their flow affects stability.
