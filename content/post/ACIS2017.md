![Complex Fluids Group UNSW](/img/GroupPhotoACIS2017Coffs.jpg)
The UNSW Complex Fluids group attended ACIS2017, the eigth biennial 
Australasian Colloid and Interface Symposium. The meeting was held in beautiful Coffs Harbour, New South Wales
from 29 January to 2 February 2017.
 
This international four-day conference had an excellent range of sessions and talks, with plenty
of time for informal networking and discussions between the international and local colloid, surface and 
interface scientists.

We look forward to new collaborations and ideas resulting from this great meeting!
