Any group has a lineage and history that has informed its focus and expertise. We are a
fairly interdisciplinary group, blending engineering, physics, chemistry, foods, and biology,
and the below texts are recommended as introductory and reference materials for anyone wanting
to deepen or broaden their pursuit of complex fluids behaviour with us.  Depending on your project,
some will be of more use than others.  

I've grouped them below into three tiers, higher tiers indicating greater difficulty or
specialisation, spanning several subjects.  These are personal and professional recommendations
based on styles of presentation and communication that helped me learn and develop concepts
over the years.  Sample as you like and build your own preferences.

### Tier 1 - Introductory and helpful conceptual explanations

### Tier 2 - More developed, mathematical, applied coverage

### Tier 3 - Specialised and "build your own" sources
