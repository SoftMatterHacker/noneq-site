UNSW library has a great many journal subscriptions you can use to access sources for your research.
We often need to work with these sources when we are off-campus, but the library restricts access
to those within its network.  A proxy server allows us to be "within UNSW's network" even
when we are far from campus. Here's how to use ours.

Let's say I need to download the colloidosome article below:
![Initially locked journal site](/img/locked_journal.png)

You see the PDF link is greyed out and if I click on it will be told I don't have access.
We can access this journal by inserting the text:

.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au

after the domain name in the address:
![Proxy address](/img/proxy_url.png)

Executing this brings up the following login page, where we enter our UNSW access information:
![Initially locked journal site](/img/login_proxy.png)

and are rewarded by a site indicating we have access through UNSW:
