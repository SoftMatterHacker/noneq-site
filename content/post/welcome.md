Hi there!  Welcome to the revamped Nonequilibrium.com, AKA SoftMatterHacker.com!  

What was once a single page CV for an industrial researcher, now serves as the web site for an academic group researching
complex fluid microstructures and flows.

The site archives our [Publications](/publication/), notifies you of [News](/post/), and 
shares tips and techniques from our work in a sort of Wiki that is tagged based on content.

The site also lists current, new, and past projects of the group for interested students and
collaborators to get an idea of what we are doing and where we could do some work together.
