Whether you pursue an Honours thesis, Master's, or PhD, you will definitely need to
make an oral presentation to your group, or a broader audience, at some point.

When you become aware of this, the first thing you need to determine is the time allotment you'll have,
 including questions.  Make sure you are clear on that: is it 15 minutes total or 15 minutes 
 plus 5 minutes for questions?
