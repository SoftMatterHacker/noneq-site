![Complex Fluids Group Posters](/img/poster_fingernail.png)

As your work progresses, either in an Honours thesis, Master's, or PhD, you will likely need 
to present a scientific poster at some point.  The hosting organization will often 
supply a template or guideline for the poster format, and this is especially helpful to
avoid changing the settings of PowerPoint (or LaTeX) yourself to print on larger-than-usual paper.

Branded templates are available on MyUNSW.

More important than paper size, the  content, organization, and style of your poster 
is your responsibility and should be your main concern. These elements will determine how 
effectively your work is presented and communicated and its ultimate impact with others.

There are many online guides available, but our group has its own style and you will do well
to learn from our experience:  

* Plan to have your poster reviewed by your supervisor *at least once*
* Focus on images and visual communication 
* This is worth emphasizing again: MINIMIZE TEXT CONTENT - Your audience does not come to a
poster session to READ, they come to SEE your results and TALK to you (make sure any text you use 
can be read from several feet away from your poster).
* Make sure the flow of your poster is clear, don't make it hard to follow from beginning to end
* Plan a one-sentence introduction/summary when someone first approaches you to chat: 
"Hi, can you tell me about your poster?" "Hi, I'm Rooney and my poster summarizes my honours project
on developing a new way to 3D print icing onto cakes with very high speed and resolution!"
