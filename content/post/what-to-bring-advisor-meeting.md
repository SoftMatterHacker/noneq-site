There's a nice blog post from the Avasthi Lab on key points for students meeting their
advisor. I agree with these points and refer you to the [post here:](http://www.avasthilab.org/2017/03/14/what-to-bring-to-a-meeting-with-your-advisor/)

They are quickly summarized here, but go read the more detailed ideas at the [original post:](http://www.avasthilab.org/2017/03/14/what-to-bring-to-a-meeting-with-your-advisor/)

1. Use time wisely, bring an agenda of items you want to discuss
2. Remind your advisor what was last discussed to get the discussion up to speed quickly.
3. Be disciplined with time, stick to the schedule
4. Include non-scientific topics if needed: lab problems, people issues, personal/health
5. Don't focus on proving that you've been working, partner to be successful.
